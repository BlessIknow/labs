# Cloud Computing - Artifact Registries and Serverless Computing Platforms

## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

#### Artifact Registries are an essential component of cloud computing platforms that provide a centralized location for storing and managing software artifacts, such as container images, libraries, and code packages.

### AWS Artifact Registries:

- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR):** A fully managed container registry that supports Docker container images. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and provides secure and scalable storage for container images.

### GCP Artifact Registries:

- **Google Container Registry (GCR):** A private container image registry that allows you to store, manage, and secure Docker container images. It provides integration with other GCP services and offers fast and reliable image distribution.

### Azure Artifact Registries:

- **Azure Container Registry (ACR):** A managed Docker registry service that allows you to store and manage container images. It provides features like image signing, geo-replication, and seamless integration with other Azure services.

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

#### Serverless computing platforms enable developers to build and run applications without having to manage underlying infrastructure.

### Best Serverless Computing Platforms:

#### AWS Serverless Computing Platforms:

- **AWS Lambda:** A serverless compute service that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. It supports various programming languages and integrates with other AWS services for event-driven application architectures.

#### GCP Serverless Computing Platforms:

- **Google Cloud Functions:** A serverless execution environment for building and running event-driven applications. It allows you to write functions in multiple languages and automatically scales based on incoming events.

#### Azure Serverless Computing Platforms:

- **Azure Functions:** A serverless compute service that enables you to run event-triggered code without worrying about infrastructure management. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates seamlessly with other Azure services.
