### Screenshot of the VM running

- I got errors while trying to run ubuntu from **VirtualBox** and when I did research on it I found out that for macOs with M1 or M2 Mac Apple Silicon,VirtualBox is not really compatible with it, so I found **UTM** (https://mac.getutm.app/) which I downloaded and was compatible with ubuntu for my M2 (https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm).
