## Steps you took to perform the Git reset operations:

- ### I created a new branch named "git-reset-practice".
- ### Made several commits with different changes to "my_file.txt".
- ### Used various git reset commands to undo the commits and observe the changes.

#

## Different `git reset` options used and their effects:

- ### Soft Reset (git reset --soft): Undoes the commit but keeps the changes in the staging area.
- ### Mixed Reset (git reset --mixed): Undoes the commit and removes the changes from the staging area, but keeps them in the working directory.
- ### Hard Reset (git reset --hard): Undoes the commit, discards the changes, and resets both the staging area and working directory.

#

# Examples and outputs of the commands executed.

## Input

- ### git reset --soft HEAD~1

## Output

- ### [git-reset-practice fe40592] Added third line to my_file.txt 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

# Reflection on the benefits and use cases of the `git reset` command in version control workflows.

- ### Undoing commits: git reset allows you to easily undo commits and modify the project's history. It provides a flexible way to backtrack and remove commits when needed.

- ### Refactoring code: When refactoring code, you might make multiple commits along the way. If you decide to go in a different direction or want to clean up the commit history, git reset helps in selectively removing or modifying commits.

- ### Separating work into multiple commits: With git reset, you can split a large commit into smaller, logical commits. By using the appropriate reset option, you can remove specific changes from the staging area or even from the working directory without losing the progress.

- ### Resetting to a specific commit: git reset allows you to reset the branch to a specific commit, effectively moving the branch pointer. This is useful when you want to discard unwanted commits or start a new line of development from an earlier point.

- ### Working with branches: git reset helps in aligning branches, especially when you want to discard commits on a branch or integrate commits from one branch into another. It provides control over the branch history and allows for a clean and organized project structure.
