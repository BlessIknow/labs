# Steps I took to set up a project on Fleek.

- I signend up on the website.
- on the dashboard I navigated to create a new site.
- The first option was to connect to my Github
- Then choose a repository I want to link to my site.
- Choose a deployment location by selecting the platform I want to host my site on.
- Then the last step was to deploy.

#

# IPFS link and custom domain of my deployed project.

#

# My observations or insights gained during the setup process.

- Though it is quite straight farwad to set up but became complicated at the point of build settings, not knowing what to select at that point and how it works.
